# BackgroundLocationUpdateDemo
In the Location and Maps Programming Guide of Apple, we can find the introduction of Getting Location Events in the Background:  iOS supports the delivery of location events to apps that are suspended or no longer running. It is verified in this demo, especially we still can get the Location info when the app has been killed.
